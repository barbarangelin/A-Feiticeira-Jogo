# A-Feiticeira-Jogo
A Visual Novel created using Ren'py Engine and story based on the short-story by Inglês de Souza

The game was created for academic purposes when I was writing a article about how video games can introduce people in the reading book world. The story is based in the short-story "A Feiticeira" by Inglês de Souza and the Engine used for the project is Ren'py since it is a free program and one of the best for development of Visual Novel games.
