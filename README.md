# A-Feiticeira-Jogo   ![license](https://badgen.net/static/license/MIT/blue) 
A Visual Novel created using Ren'py Engine and story based on the short-story by Inglês de Souza

The game was created for academic purposes when I was writing a article about how video games can introduce people in the reading book world. The story is based in the short-story "A Feiticeira" (_The Witch_) by Inglês de Souza and the Engine used for the project is Ren'py since it is a free program and one of the best for development of Visual Novel games.

<sub> **The game history language is pt-br</sub>

**The game includes:**

- Original short-story text with minimun changes
- Original gui design using PhotoshopCS6
- Original characters design using PaintToolSAI
- Backgrounds images from free images banks (some background images have been edited using PhotoshopCS6)
- Background music and sound effects from free sound banks
